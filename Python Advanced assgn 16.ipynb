    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions help in validation of text strings which are of programmerâ€™s interest. It offers a powerful tool for analyzing, searching a pattern and modifying the text data. It helps in searching specific string pattern and extracting matching results in a flexible manner. It helps in parsing text files looking for a defined sequence of characters for further analysis or data manipulation.\n",
